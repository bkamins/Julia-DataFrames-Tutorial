# ## Load and save DataFrames
# We do not cover all features of the packages. Please refer to their documentation to learn them.
# 
# Here we'll load `CSV` to read and write CSV files and `JLD`, which allows us to work with a Julia native binary format.

using CSV
using JLD

# Let's create a simple `DataFrame` for testing purposes,

x = DataFrame(A=[true, false, true], B=[1, 2, missing],
              C=[missing, "b", "c"], D=['a', missing, 'c'])


# and use `eltypes` to look at the columnwise types.

eltypes(x)

# Let's use `CSV` to save `x` to disk; make sure `x.csv` does not conflict with some file in your working directory.

CSV.write("x.csv", x)

# Now we can see how it was saved by reading `x.csv`.

print(read("x.csv", String))

# We can also load it back. `use_mmap=false` disables memory mapping so that on Windows the file can be deleted in the same session.

y = CSV.read("x.csv", use_mmap=false)

# When loading in a `DataFrame` from a `CSV`, all columns allow `Missing` by default. Note that the column types have changed!

eltypes(y)

# Now let's save `x` to a file in a binary format; make sure that `x.jld` does not exist in your working directory.

save("x.jld", "x", x)

# After loading in `x.jld` as `y`, `y` is identical to `x`.

y = load("x.jld", "x")

# Note that the column types of `y` are the same as those of `x`!

eltypes(y)

# Next, we'll create the files `bigdf.csv` and `bigdf.jld`, so be careful that you don't already have these files on disc!
# 
# In particular, we'll time how long it takes us to write a `DataFrame` with 10^3 rows and 10^5 columns to `.csv` and `.jld` files.  *You can expect JLD to be faster!* Use `compress=true` to reduce file sizes.

bigdf = DataFrame(Bool, 10^3, 10^2)
@time CSV.write("bigdf.csv", bigdf)
@time save("bigdf.jld", "bigdf", bigdf)
getfield.(stat.(["bigdf.csv", "bigdf.jld"]), :size)

# Finally, let's clean up. Do not run the next cell unless you are sure that it will not erase your important files.

foreach(rm, ["x.csv", "x.jld", "bigdf.csv", "bigdf.jld"])
